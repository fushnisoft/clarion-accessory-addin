# clarion-accessory-addin

This addin creates a menu item in the Clarion7+ IDE for use by 3rdParty/Accessory vendors. 
It provides translations for the menu label as well as an option dialog to allow the user to specify the location of the menu item.

Currently there is nothing packaged up for download but clone the repo and poke around!
